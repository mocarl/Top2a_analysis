## Define the two channels you want to analyse. Channel1 is assumed to be channel of interest.
## Coloc is defined as particles having any overlapping point on a circle defined by the particles mass centre and a radius derived from particle area.
## The particles is assumed to be perfect circles in this approach as this is the most likely footprint of a true protein condensate.
## See outline images with particle mask for true geometry of detected particles.
