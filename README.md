### Statistical analysis of particles deposited on functionalized glass slides
Scripts and functions contained within the repository is aimed to perform statistical analysis on particles deposited on functionalized cover glass
Images are first analysed with Imagej and the macro written within that environment to detect and measure particles on deoposited on the surface. 
The data is then consolidated and arranged by suitable scripts within the R project. After consolidation use the copy function to copy .xlsx files to the Data folder within the project wd.
This will allow all paths used within scripts and functions to work as intended. 

# Make note that no data should be committed to the repository. Make sure that the Data folder is included in .gitignore

# For functions and scripts to work open always open the project via the Project file and run the "dependencies" script at start up
